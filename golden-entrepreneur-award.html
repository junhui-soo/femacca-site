                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-0 display-7">In 1996, Dato' Sri Lee Ee Hoe and Dato' Sri Koh Yock Heng, two Japanese students from Malaysia established the travel agency known as "Apple Vacations". With an initial investment of RM 15,000, Dato' Sri Lee Ee Hoe, serving as the managing director, was determined to foster the growth of Apple Vacations and transform it into a leading "Malaysian Fun Travel Agency" from the very beginning.<br>The two founders grew up in the small town of Yong Peng in the state of Johor, Malaysia. They studied together in Japan and, for the past 18 years, have remained dedicated to the original mission of their venture. They have continuously explored new attractions and distinguished themselves in providing immersive themed travel experiences, making Apple Vacations the largest tourism group in Malaysia and a benchmark travel agency for domestic travel brands.<br>In recent years, Apple Vacations has transformed into the Apple Vacation Group, comprising five major business sectors: tourism, hospitality, media and information services (101 Media), food and beverage, and real estate. The group has expanded its business industry chain and developed into a regional tourism group. It has established branches in Indonesia and Singapore and plans to set up branches in other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.</p>

                        Currently, the Apple Vacation Group has set its corporate goal as "Apple Vision 2018," aiming to become a renowned employer in the domestic tourism industry with 500 employees and 100 professional tour guides. The group also aims to achieve a revenue of RM 1 billion by 2018 and ensure that its employees receive an annual salary of at least RM 60,000 or more. The ultimate goal of this vision is to take the Apple Group public. Dato' Sri Lee Ee Hoe, the Managing Director of the Apple Group, stated that going public is a commitment to both customers and employees, signifying that Apple has reached a stable stage and is a recognized brand. Going public would be an ideal milestone.
