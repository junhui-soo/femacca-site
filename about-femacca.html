Therefore, Hsin Chong is determined to lead the transformation and change of all industries in China, so that it can keep pace with the times and stay at the cutting edge of technology, and avoid the relevant industries from being eliminated in the flood of the development of the times.<br>The transformation and change of Hsin Kuang also starts from itself, which includes leading two overseas study trips for the council members in 2015, including the successful IT companies of today, namely Huawei and Wechat headquarters, to let the council members understand the new IT trends. At the same time, in order to give greater recognition to various industries in China, especially through the sharing of experiences and struggles of successful entrepreneurs, which will serve as a model for other entrepreneurs and bring positive effects to the development of the industry, the Executive Committee also organized the first Golden Scholar Award for Malaysian enterprises in the end of 2013 and will continue to organize the second Golden Scholar Award in 2014. Through the awards, the entrepreneurs are given recognition and praise, which injects positive energy into the industry and helps to promote the growth of the industry.<br>Through the awards, and in conjunction with SAME's various programs, including business matching, venture capital investment, and corporate finance and loans, we encourage innovation and change in the domestic industry so that it can continue to stand firm in the domestic market and move further into the international arena.</p>
